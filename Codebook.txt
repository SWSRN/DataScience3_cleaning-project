STUDY DESIGN
==============

  Data on the detectors measuring human movement was downloaded, representing data collected 
  from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  A description of the 
  input data is  

  	http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
  
  Here are the input data for the project:

	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
	
  A subset of the processed data was selected for our study; only those with average 
  features ("mean") or standard deviation ("std"). Means of (oddly enough) means and 
  standard deviations) were calculated from all subsetted measurements of each variable 
  for given index values of the activity("walking", "walking_upstairs", etc.).  
  
  In the absence of detailed instructions, variables containing similar substrings such as 
  "Mean" where not included. 
  
  Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.

THE INSTRUCTION LIST
=====================

	Load script 'run_analysis.R' in R. No parameters are necessary.
	
	run_analysis.R assumes that the following files are in the local directory.
	
	- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
	- 'features.txt': List of all features.
	- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
	- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
	- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
	- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
	- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
	
	Output file with tidy data is 'means.txt' in the local directory.
